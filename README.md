# ðŸ“¡ 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi Coexistence Simulation with Reinforcement Learning

This repository provides a Python-based simulation environment built on **SimPy** that models the **MAC-layer behavior** of 5G NR-U and Wi-Fi networks operating under saturated traffic conditions. The simulation captures the dynamic and competitive nature of the unlicensed spectrum where heterogeneous wireless technologies coexist.

5G NR-U employs scheduled transmissions governed by Listen-Before-Talk (LBT), while Wi-Fi operates using a distributed contention-based protocol, namely CSMA/CA. These fundamental differences can lead to unfair spectrum access and performance degradation when both technologies compete in congested environments.

## ðŸ”¬ Implemented Approaches

This codebase includes implementations of the following algorithms for **Coexistence Parameter Management (CPM)**:
* Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL)
* Primal-Dual Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL)
* QaSAL: QoS-aware State-Augmented Learnable Algorithm

These learning-based approaches aim to tune MAC-layer parameters to improve fairness and meet Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements in mixed-technology environments.
